In the world of information technology, localization means translating and adapting a product or service to a particular language, culture, and geographic market.\n\nThere are two main aspects to localization. The first one is stylistic: You have to make sure the language tone you use is appropriate for each local culture. There\u2019s also a technical aspect: You may have to make changes to things like date and time formats, alphabetization, or even the direction of reading, to make them appropriate for the language you\u2019re localizing into. So localization means more than just translating a message or text, it\u2019s about making a whole product feel tailored to users everywhere. \n\nThis need for localized content has made the language industry the 4th fastest growing industry in the world with a global size of an estimated $40 billion. More people across the globe are coming online, and they need to be able to use technology in a language they understand. That\u2019s what localization is all about.",

      "syllabus": "In this course, you'll learn how important version control is to professional development. You'll install the Git shell command and configure it. You'll use the `git` command to create repositories that are local to your machine. Using this same command, you'll copy existing Git repositories to your computer. You will learn about how important it is to check the status of a repository. You'll track changes to projects using small, focused packages called commits. You'll learn how to navigate existing commits and the importance of providing clear, descriptive commit messages. You'll work on the same project in different situations using branches. Using the `git` command, you'll merge branches together and resolve any merge conflicts if they should arise. Lastly, if there are any issues with commits, you'll learn how to go back in time to alter, reverse, or totally delete commits.\n\n## Lesson 1: Purpose & Terminology\n* Learn why developers use version control and discover ways you use version control in your daily life\n* Get an overview of essential Git vocabulary\n* Configure Git using the command line\n\n## Lesson 2: Create a Git Repo\n* Create your first Git repository with `git init`\n* Copy an existing Git repository with `git clone`\n* Review the current state of a repository with the powerful `git status`\n\n\n## Lesson 3: Review a Repo's History\n* Review a repo's commit history`git log`\n* Customize `git log`'s output using command line flags in order to reveal more (or less) information about each commit\n* Use the `git show` command to display just one commit\n\n## Lesson 4: Add Commits to a Repo\n* Master the Git workflow and make commits to an example project\n* Use `git diff` to identify what parts of a file have been changed in a commit\n* Learn how to mark files as \"untracked\" using `.gitignore`\n\n## Lesson 5: Tagging, Branching, and Merging\n* Organize your commits with tags and branches\n* Jump to particular tags and branches using `git checkout`\n* Learn how to merge together changes on different branches and crush those pesky merge conflicts\n\n## Lesson 6: Undoing Changes\n* Learn how and when to edit or delete an existing commit\n* Use `git commit`'s `--amend` flag to alter the last commit\n* Use `git reset` and `git revert` to undo and erase commits",

You\u2019ll also get a first look at the web accessibility guidelines (WAI \u2013 Web Accessibility Initiative), understand what \u201cPOUR\u201d means for accessibility, and locate checklists to help make your own sites accessible.\n\n## Lesson 2: Focus\nIn this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to make a page usable for anyone navigating with the keyboard. This starts with an introduction to the concept of focus (the element on the page to which keyboard events will be targeted), how to make elements focusable and when, and the order in which focusable elements will be traversed when exploring the page with the keyboard. You\u2019ll also learn how to manage focus in forms, in custom components, pop-ups, and off-screen content. \n\n## Lesson 3: Semantics Basics\nIn this lesson you\u2019ll build on keyboard navigation to make a page work for people who are unable to use a standard user interface, including users who can't see the screen. This requires ensuring assistive technology (such as screen readers) has sufficient information to present an alternative UI. You\u2019ll use a screen reader to try out ordinary form elements and add markup to make them work even better. You\u2019ll understand the accessibility tree the browser constructs from the DOM. Finally, you\u2019ll learn how to built-in HTML features to ensure the accessibility tree accurately reflects the visual UI. \n\n## Lesson 4: Semantics Extras\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll dive deeper into the screen-reader experience to add hyper-fast navigation. You\u2019ll learn how to arrange headings and label links so screen reader users can fly through your pages! You\u2019ll also learn how to call out \u201clandmarks\u201d into your page to speed up navigation even more. (As a bonus, this \u201csemantic markup\u201d  also makes your markup more readable!)\n\n## Lesson 5: Semantics - ARIA\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll move beyond the native elements of HTML into building custom controls and interactions. Of course you want these to be accessible, and that\u2019s where ARIA comes in \u2013 Accessible Rich Internet Applications. You\u2019ll learn how to add attributes to your custom interactions to make them as accessible as native elements. You\u2019ll also learn how to manage these attributes from Javascript as the user interacts with your page.\n\n## Lesson 6: Style\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll learn the third pillar of Accessibility (after Focus and Semantics): Styling. Your page\u2019s styles need to support highlighting the focus, indicating ARIA states, being zoomed in or out, and viewed by people with limited color or contrast vision. You\u2019ll learn how to audit your page with the Chrome Accessibility Tools and correct any styling issues that pop up, as well as designing with accessibility in mind.",

Knowing this in advance, and preparing accordingly, is the key to success. \n\nThis course was designed to give you what you need to ace a technical interview. Included are:\n\n - videos that walk you through the algorithms and data structures concepts commonly asked in technical interviews\n - an explanation of efficiency, and an explanation of how it relates to topics covered throughout the class\n - practice problems and quizzes to test your understanding\n - a mock interview with a breakdown explaining how interviewers expect you to explain your thought process\n - curated links to outside resources, including a special link to live practice interviewing with other Udacity students on Pramp \n - if you\u2019re a Nanodegree student, a final project where you can answer interview questions and get feedback from a trained reviewer.\n\nThe goal of this course is to prepare you for a real technical interview, so we focus on the material you'll actually be expected to do.",

If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.\n\n### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons?\n\n Yes!

If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.\n\n### What are the rules on collaboration?\n\n Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. \n\n### Why are there so many questions?\n\n Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.\n\n### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos?\n\n Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

More specifically, we will talk about the projects we will build and the ideas we will learn in this course. Then we will conduct a short test to ensure you have all the prerequisites necessary for the course. Finally, we will work together to download Python on your computer.\n\n### Lesson 1: Using Functions (3.5 hours)\nWe will use functions (webbrowser.open and os.rename) from the Python Standard Library to build two projects in this lesson. After that we will present a scenario where using functions will not present a very elegant solution; this will illuminate the need for a new programming tool called Classes.\n\n### Lesson 2: Using Classes (5 hours)\nHere we will learn about important object-oriented programming concepts like classes and instances. We will build three cool projects while using classes. These include drawing shapes with Turtle, sending text messages with Twilio and checking curse words with a function called open.\n\nWe will leverage modules from within the Python Standard Library and also learn to download and use an external Python package (twilio).\n\n### Lesson 3: Making Classes (5 hours)\nIn this lesson we will learn to create our first class. While doing this we will build a website that plays trailers of your favorite movies. Here are some of the programming ideas we will learn in this lesson:\n\n- How to create a class\n- How to instantiate an object\n- How to access class attributes and methods \n- What is the self keyword\n- What are constructors (\\__init__)\n- What are DocStrings\n- How to create and access Class Variables\n- How does Inheritance work\n- How to override methods  \n\n### Final Project (6 hours)\nHere, you will use the skills learned in this course to identify a problem statement and idea for a project. You will then identify step-by step directions (in simple English) to design a solution for the previously identified problem. Finally, you will use this design and your newly learned object-oriented programming skills to write code to realize your project.",

      "faq": "Before course development started, we asked you what questions you had about Apple's Swift language. Here are the answers to your most burning questions:\n\n### Why is the language called Swift?\nThe language was designed with two goals in mind: to be (1) swift to code, and (2) swift to execute. In terms of speed, Swift compiles Swift code to optimized native code depending on target device. In terms of learning curve, the Swift syntax was designed to be clean and easy to read. \n\n### Should I learn Swift or Objective-C?\nSwift! Apple has made it clear that Swift is the cornerstone of the future of iOS development. Plus, you can still utilize Objective-C files alongside Swift code, so you won\u2019t miss out on any pre-existing libraries and code.\n\n### How easy is Swift to learn?\nSwift was designed to be friendly for new programmers, and as a result it is incredibly easy to learn. <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/Swift\/Conceptual\/Swift_Programming_Language\/\">According to Apple<\/a>, Swift is the \u201cfirst industrial-quality systems programming language that is as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language.\u201d Some have even <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/why-apples-swift-might-be-the-new-basic-and-thats-no-small-thing-7000030186\/\" target=\"_blank\">called Swift the new BASIC<\/a>.\n\n### Is it fast?\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/swift\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple boasts<\/a> that Swift is up to 2.6x faster than Objective-C and 8.4x faster than Python 2.7. And why should you care about how quickly code executes? Well, faster running code makes for more efficient and smoother running apps, which makes for a better experience for your user.\n\n### Why did Apple decide to create a new language?\nObjective-C has been Apple\u2019s primary programming language for app writing since OS X was created. In that time, programming languages and practices changed drastically, especially in mobile development. Rather than adopt a new, already existing language, Apple created a new language tailored specifically for development on their own hardware.\n\n### Can I create an app in Swift and submit it to the App Store?\nAbsolutely! In fact, you were able to as soon as Xcode 6 and iOS 8 launched.\n\n### Why was there a need to go from Objective-C to Swift?\nAs mentioned in the answer to question five, after 20 years, Objective-C was starting to show it\u2019s age. Plus, Objective-C is a difficult language for new programmers to learn, so the barrier to entry is pretty high. Swift provides a modern language tailor-made for Apple hardware.\n\n### How Stable is Swift?\nAs with any new language, there is a potential for bugs. While you may encounter some trouble with the Swift language, the majority of issues were addressed before the 1.0 release.\n\nThe thing to most look out for is changes to the Swift language during each update. For example, when updating from 1.0 to 1.1, Apple introduced a new feature: <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/swift\/blog\/?id=17\" target=\"_blank\">failable initializers<\/a>. You can expect that the language will change as more people use it and give feedback to Apple. Stay apprised of changes using the <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/Swift\/Conceptual\/Swift_Programming_Language\/RevisionHistory.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40014097-CH40-XID_1655\" target=\"_blank\">revision history for *The Swift Programming Language*<\/a>.\n\n### What other languages is it similar to?\nSwift is probably most similar in look and feel to Ruby or Python. Though you\u2019ll also probably recognize some C syntax. \n\n### Is it compatible with iOS 6 & 7?\nSwift can be run on iOS 7, but not iOS 6.",

      "syllabus": "### Lesson 1 - Authentication vs. Authorization\nLearn the difference between the concepts of authentication and authorization and address some major security concerns that developers must protect against when developing a web application.  You will learn how OAuth 2.0 makes implementing security easier for developers and users alike by allowing your users to sign in to your applications while keeping all of the security on well-known and trusted OAuth providers. Finally, you will see OAuth 2.0 in action as you make API requests using Google's OAuth 2.0 Playground.\n\n### Lesson 2 - Creating a Google+ Sign-In\nLearn about the different types of security flows your application can implement. You will see how security can be handled by your server, your user's browser, or both depending on the type of security your application needs.  You will then add a Google+ Sign-In to an existing web application and implement a hybridized client\/server flow.\n\n\n### Lesson 3 - Local Permission Systems\nAdd python code to create server-side rules that will constitute a permission system. This system will limit access of the database for each logged in user based on how the developer designs this code. You will add a User model model to your database to store the credentials, such as username, email, and profile picture, collected from the OAuth provider's API.\n\n###Lesson 4 - Adding Facebook & Other Providers\nLearn to implement multiple OAuth providers on your web application. You will add Facebook Login as an alternative sign in option for your users and understand how to use OAuth provider documentation to add as many providers as you see fit for your application.",

The first one is an overview of responsive design and introduces the way you\u2019ll need to shift your thinking as you go from desktop first design, to responsive design.  Lessons 2, 3, 4 and 5 will cover the important theoretical concepts of responsive design, and include plenty of hands-on exercises implementing what you\u2019ve learned.  \n\n### Lesson 1 - Why Responsive?\nWhat is responsive web design and why is it important? What kinds of devices should we be targeting with our design? How can we best leverage the different capabilities of each device to provide great experiences to users? You\u2019ll also make sure that your development environment is ready to go. \n\n<strong>Topics covered:<\/strong>\n\n* What is responsive design?\n* Why does responsive design work for any device?\n* Remote debugging and emulation in the browser\n\n### Lesson 2 - Starting Small\nThe best way to get started is to start small and build up. In this lesson, we\u2019ll cover the key components that make a site great on a small screen, including setting the viewport, adding content and sizing the content to the viewport.  You\u2019ll start the home town site project, by making sure that it looks good on a small screen.  \n\n<strong>Topics covered:<\/strong>\n\n* Why start small and build up?\n* What is the viewport?\n* Sizing the content to the viewport\n  * avoiding static sized items\n* Touch targets, and why they should be large\n\n### Lesson 3 - Building Up\nOnce you\u2019ve got a page optimized for small screens, it\u2019s time to start thinking about how they\u2019ll look on larger screens.  Learn how to use CSS media queries to add breakpoints that change the layout depending on the screen size or other device characteristics.\n\n<strong>Topics covered:<\/strong>\n\n* CSS media queries\n* What is a breakpoint, and how to choose one\n* Using the CSS flexbox to modify layout\n\n### Lesson 4 - Common Responsive Patterns\nNow that you\u2019ve got the basics of responsive design down, you\u2019ll learn about and practice some of the common layout design patterns used across sites. You'll also iterate on the home town site project, creating breakpoints for tablet and desktop layouts using the patterns from this lesson.\n\n<strong>Topics covered:<\/strong>\n\n* Mostly fluid pattern\n* Column drop pattern\n* Layout shifter pattern\n* Off canvas pattern\n\n### Lesson 5 - Optimizations\nLearn strategies for minor breakpoints used to adjust the margins or padding on an element, or increase the font size to make it feel more natural in the layout. You\u2019ll also learn about strategies for dealing with tables and optimal text readability. At the end of the lesson, you'll iterate for the last time on the home town site, adding minor breakpoints to really make the experience stand out.\n\n<strong>Topics covered:<\/strong>\n\n* Minor break points\n* Optimizing text layout\n  * font size\n  * optimal line length\n* Responsive tables, and strategies for dealing with them",

In this lesson, you will start with comparing different kinds of images on the web and getting familiar with different units you can use to scale them.\n\nYou will also get a chance to set up your development environment so that responsive images become a painless part of your workflow.\n\nAt the end of the lesson, you will start working on the responsive blog project, where you have a chance to apply responsive image principles in a real-world scenario!\n\n<strong>Topics covered:<\/strong>\n\n* Sizing Images\n* File Types\n* Automation Tools\n\n### Lesson 3 - Images with Markup\n\nNot all graphics need to be .JPGs or .PNGs. This lesson dives into using markup techniques like CSS and icon fonts to create responsive graphics. While markup techniques are awesome because they are natively responsive, they are often **extremely** lightweight, requiring a fraction of the bytes of traditional images!\n\nAt the end of the lesson, you will replace extraneous images with markup techniques and take advantage of font icons to add social media icons to the responsive blog project!\n\n<strong>Topics covered:<\/strong>\n\n* CSS Techniques\n* Inlining Images\n* Unicode\n* Icon fonts\n\n### Lesson 4 - Full Responsiveness\n\nHere comes the full monty!

Lesson 6 will be a short intro on an easy way to create native mobile apps that talk to your backend.\n\n###Lesson 1: Scalability Basics\nDo you know how and why server racks were invented years ago? Have you realized all of the problems that you have to solve if you will try to scale your app by yourself? Learn about a better way.\n\n###Lesson 2: Getting Started\nSet up your first App Engine project and learn how to define Cloud Endpoints. \n\nStart the course project app - Conference Central and add authentication and user profiles.\n\n###Lesson 3: Storing and Retrieving Data\nOne of the most important things you want to do in your app is storing data. In this lesson you will learn what is Google App Engine Datastore, how is it different from RDBMS and how you can use it in your applications.\n\nAdd the ability to store and retrieve user profiles and conferences to the course project app.\n\n###Lesson 4: Advanced Datastore Concepts\nLearn more about how Datastore works, including queries, filters, indexes and transactions. \n\nAdd different ways to query conferences.\n\n###Lesson 5: Advanced App Engine Topics\nThere are a lot of things you might want your application to do in background, without making the user wait, or even initiate the process. Learn about task queues and cron jobs and how you can use them to add advanced functionality to your app. You will also learn about Memcache, and get an overview of topics like Edge Caching, AppStats and other methods of optimizing your apps performance.\n\nAdd a push queue, cron job and a customized Memcache entry to your app.",

You will then setup your very own Linux virtual machine on your own computer and explore that system, learning how the filesystem is organized and identifying key files.\n\n## Lesson 2- Linux Security\n\nAs you unleash your new server onto the Internet you'll need to be a good citizen - and this means, **security**! In this lesson, you'll learn how to execute administrative tasks, update the software on your system, install new software, and manage users. You'll then learn how to implement even stronger authentication mechanisms, how to interpret Linux file permission and, finally, how to configure a firewall to keep your system secure.\n\n## Lesson 3 - Web Application Servers\n\nIn this lesson you'll transform your secure and safe barebones server into a fully functional web application server by installing and configuring the Apache HTTP Server and PostgreSQL database server. You'll then write a very basic Python WSGI application that can query a database and present that data upon a web request.",

If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.\n\n### What are the rules on collaboration?\n\n Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. \n\n### Why are there so many questions?\n\n Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.\n\n### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos?\n\n Learn actively!

Designing good A\/B tests and drawing valid conclusions can be difficult. You can almost never measure exactly what you want to know (such as whether the users are \"happier\" on one version of the site), so you need to find good proxies. You need sanity checks to make sure your experimental set-up isn't flawed, and you need to use a variety of statistical techniques to make sure the results you're seeing aren't due to chance.

      "syllabus": "### Lesson 1: Overview of A\/B Testing\nThis lesson will cover what A\/B testing is and what it can be used for. It will also cover an example A\/B test from start to finish, including how to decide how long to run the experiment, how to construct a binomial confidence interval for the results, and how to decide whether the change is worth the launch cost.\n\n### Lesson 2: Policy and Ethics for Experiments\nThis lesson will cover how to make sure the participants of your experiments are adequately protected and what questions you should be asking regarding the ethicality of experiments. It will cover four main ethics principles to consider when designing experiments: the risk to the user, the potential benefits, what alternatives users have to participating in the experiment, and the sensitivity of the data being collected.\n\n### Lesson 3: Choosing and Characterizing Metrics\nOne of the most important and time-consuming pieces of designing an A\/B test is choosing and validating metrics to use in evaluating your experiment. This lesson will cover techniques for brainstorming metrics, what to do when you can't measure what you want directly, and characteristics you should consider when validating your metrics.\n\n### Lesson 4: Designing an Experiment\nThis lesson will cover how to design an A\/B test. This includes how to choose which users will be in your experiment and control group - different online definitions of a \"user\", and what effects different choices will have on your experiment. It will also cover when to  limit your experiment to a subset of your entire user base, how to calculate how many events you will need in order to draw strong conclusions from your results, and how this translates into how long to run the experiment. Finally, the lesson will cover how various design decisions affect the size of your experiment, so you will know which decisions to revisit if you need results more quickly.\n\n### Lesson 5: Analyzing Results\nThis lesson will cover how to analyze the results of your experiments. Step one is always to run some sanity checks so that you can catch problems with your experiment set-up. Then, you will learn how to check conclusions with multiple methods, including a hypothesis test on the effect size and a binomial sign test, if you get results that surprise you. You will also learn how measuring multiple metrics for the same experiment can make analysis difficult, and some techniques for handling multiple metrics. Finally, you will learn about several analysis \"gotchas\", and what to do if you see them, including how Simpson's Paradox can affect A\/B tests, and why even statistically significant results might disappear when you launch.\n\n### Final Project: Design and Analyze an A\/B Test\nMake design decisions for an A\/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A\/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.",

You should also be able to describe concepts like functions and objects. Our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/course\/intro-to-computer-science--cs101\" target=\"_blank\">Intro to Computer Science<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/course\/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036\" target=\"_blank\">Programming Fundamentals with Python<\/a> courses are great places to get started.\n\nBasic knowledge of HTML and CSS (structuring and styling a web page) is not required but highly recommended. We suggest taking the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/course\/intro-to-html-and-css--ud304\" target=\"_blank\">Intro to HTML and CSS<\/a> course if you have no experience with HTML or CSS.\n\nThis course is unique in that the final project can be completed using either dimple.js or d3.js. The visualization library, dimple.js, is easier to use than d3.js and requires less background knowledge. Furthermore, a graphic can be created in considerably fewer lines of code using dimple.js as opposed to d3.js.\n\nSo why should you learn d3.js?\n\nData Driven Documents (d3.js) allows you to build highly customized graphics. If you would like to gain more technical skills and learn more about Javascript and open web standards, then you should complete Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 in order to prepare for the final project.\n\n\nIf you would like to complete the final project using d3.js, you should have some experience reading and using documentation. For example, you should be able to code a `for` loop in Javascript or be able to look up the syntax to work with strings and arrays in Javascript. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/course\/ud804\" target=\"_blank\">Javascript Basics<\/a> course if you have little to no experience with Javascript.",

In this lesson, you will meet data visualization experts, learn about data visualization in the context of data science, and learn how to represent data values in visual form.\n\n### Lesson 1b D3 Building Blocks (4 hours)\nLearn how to use the open standards of the web to create graphical elements. You\u2019ll learn how to select elements on the page, add SVG elements, and how to style SVG elements. Make use of all the Instructor Notes throughout this lesson if you have little to no experience with HTML and CSS.\n\n### Mini-Project 1: RAW Visualization (2 hours)\nCreate a data visualization using a software of your choice. We will provide recommendations for visualization software as well as data sets. We want you to get right into making data visualization so here\u2019s your first chance!\n\n### Lesson 2a Design Principles (2 hours)\nWhich chart type should I use for my data? Which colors should I avoid when making graphics? How do I know if my graphic is effective? Investigate these questions, and learn about the World Cup data set which will be use throughout the rest of the course.\n\n### Lesson 2b Dimple.js (4 hours)\nLearn how to create graphics using the Dimple JavaScript library. You will learn about this library as a gentle coding introduction before learning about D3.js. You will be able to produce great graphics with minimal code, and all of your graphics will come with interactivity without any extra effort on your part. Dimple, it's simple!\n\n### Mini-Project 2: Take Two (2-5 hours)\nFind an existing data visualization, critique it for what it does well and what it doesn\u2019t do well, and finally, recreate the graphic using a software tool of your choice. We recommend using Dimple.js, which is covered in Lesson 2b, but we don\u2019t want you to feel constrained by the choice of tools. Use any tool that works for you.\n\n### Special Note\nAt this point in the course, you can start the final project. The remaining content of the course covers narrative structures, types of bias, and maps. All of the code  in Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 pertains to d3.js. If you'd like to learn d3.js and complete the final project using d3.js, then please continue. If you prefer to stop, you can complete the final project using dimple.js.\n\n### Lesson 3 Narratives (5 hours)\nLearn how to incorporate different narrative structures into your visualizations and code along with Jonathan as you create a graphic for the World Cup data set. You\u2019ll learn about different types of bias in the data visualization process and learn how to add context to your data visualizations. By the end of this lesson, you\u2019ll have a solid foundation in D3.js.\n\n### Lesson 4 Animation and Interaction (5 hours)\nStatic graphics are great, but interactive graphics can be even better. Learn how to leverage animation and interaction to bring more data insights to your audience. Code along with Jonathan once again as you learn how to create a bubble map for the World Cup data set.\n\n### Final Project: Making an Effective Data Visualization (2 hours or more)\nYou will create a data visualization that conveys a clear message about a data set. You will use dimple.js or d3.js and collect feedback along the way to arrive at a polished product.\n####<b>NOTE:<\/b> As a free student, you are welcome to complete the project to showcase your learning; however, only students enrolled in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/course\/nd002\" target=\"_blank\">Data Analyst Nanodegree<\/a> are able to submit the final project for review and certificate.

      "syllabus": "You\u2019ll learn how to start with a question and\/or a dataset, and use machine learning to turn them into insights. \n\n###Lessons 1-4: Supervised Classification\n\n**Naive Bayes:** We jump in headfirst, learning perhaps the world\u2019s greatest algorithm for classifying text.\n\n**Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** One of the top 10 algorithms in machine learning, and a must-try for many classification tasks.  What makes it special?  The ability to generate new features independently and on the fly.\n\n**Decision Trees:** Extremely straightforward, often just as accurate as an SVM but (usually) way faster.  The launch point for more sophisticated methods, like random forests and boosting.\n\n###Lesson 5: Datasets and Questions\nBehind any great machine learning project is a great dataset that the algorithm can learn from.  We were inspired by a treasure trove of email and financial data from the Enron corporation, which would normally be strictly confidential but became public when the company went bankrupt in a blizzard of fraud.  Follow our lead as we wrestle this dataset into a machine-learning-ready format, in anticipation of trying to predict cases of fraud.\n\n###Lesson 6 and 7: Regressions and Outliers\nRegressions are some of the most widely used machine learning algorithms, and rightly share prominence with classification.  What\u2019s a fast way to make mistakes in regression, though?  Have troublesome outliers in your data.  We\u2019ll tackle how to identify and clean away those pesky data points.\n\n###Lesson 8: Unsupervised Learning\n\n**K-Means Clustering:** The flagship algorithm when you don\u2019t have labeled data to work with, and a quick method for pattern-searching when approaching a dataset for the first time.\n\n###Lessons 9-12: Features, Features, Features\n\n**Feature Creation:** Taking your human intuition about the world and turning it into data that a computer can use.\n\n**Feature Selection:** Einstein said it best: make everything as simple as possible, and no simpler.  In this case, that means identifying the most important features of your data.\n\n**Principal Component Analysis:** A more sophisticated take on feature selection, and one of the crown jewels of unsupervised learning.\n\n**Feature Scaling:** Simple tricks for making sure your data and your algorithm play nicely together.\nLearning from Text: More information is in text than any other format, and there are some effective but simple tools for extracting that information.\n\n###Lessons 13-14: Validation and Evaluation\n\n**Training\/testing data split:** How do you know that what you\u2019re doing is working?  You don\u2019t, unless you validate.  The train-test split is simple to do, and the gold standard for understanding your results.\n\n**Cross-validation:** Take the training\/testing split and put it on steroids.  Validate your machine learning results like a pro.\n\n**Precision, recall, and F1 score:**  After all this data-driven work, quantify your results with metrics tailored to what is most important to you.\n \n###Lesson 15: Wrapping it all Up\nWe take a step back and review what we\u2019ve learned, and how it all fits together.  \n\n###Projects\n\nMini-project at the end of each lesson\n\n**Final project:** searching for signs of corporate fraud in Enron data",

      "syllabus": "###Lesson 1: How the Web Works (2.5 hours)\nIn this first lesson, you will learn basic concepts regarding the internet, browsers, HTML, and how all those elements fit together. You\u2019ll start using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) to format content for webpages. Then you\u2019ll get to see the mechanics of how the web works: HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) via GET and POST requests. In the first problem set, you will get a simple website up and running with the Google App Engine platform. \n\n###Lesson 2: Forms and Input (4 hours)\nIn this second lesson you will learn about forms, a very common way to obtain input from users. You will learn how to get and process user input from webpages using Google App Engine to get a live form up and running. By the end of this lesson, you will know how to validate user input and securely obtain data from users.\n\n\n###Lesson 3: Databases (6 hours)\nYou learned about getting all sorts of information from users in the previous lesson, but what do you do with it once it\u2019s in your hands? You store it! In this third lesson, Steve will dive in and teach you what you need to know about databases, the final piece you need to start setting your blog in motion! You will learn about various database technologies, SQL, and the Google App Engine Datastore.\n\n###Lesson 4: User Accounts and Security (6 hours)\nIn this fourth lesson, you will learn the fundamentals of authentication and security, which are very relevant topics in almost any web application built today. We\u2019ll start by examining how websites use cookies to authenticate users and how we can manage cookies from the backend of a web application. You will implement a login system for your blog and learn how to use hashing to securely read and transmit user passwords.\n\n###Lesson 5: APIs (4.5 hours)\nUp until now, your programs have generated HTML that a browser can use to render a web page for the user. In the digital world, however, applications and websites communicate not only with people, but also with other applications and websites. By the end of this lesson, your blog will communicate with humans as well as with other computers. Your web application can generate data in formats such as XML and JSON that other computers can access through an API, or application programming interface. Those computers, in turn, can build websites or services that interact with your data. You\u2019ll first learn how to use APIs, and then build web applications as services so that other computers can glean data from your application. We will look at both XML and JSON by investigating how to read them, how to interpret them, and how to manipulate them. \n\n###Lesson 6: Caching (3.5 hours)\nIn this lesson, we will explore how to prepare your applications to run at a large scale. So far, we've written 'toy' applications for just one or two users. If we want to start writing apps for thousands or, perhaps, even millions of users, then obviously we'll need to think about scaling. When we talk about scaling, this may mean running your application on multiple machines, storing huge amounts of data, or consuming large amounts of bandwidth. In particular, we will learn about caching, including the uses of caching, why you might want to cache, and specific caching implementations such as Memcached. \n\n###Lesson 7: Scaling Up (2.5 hours)\nIn this last lesson of the course, Steve has prepared a relaxing, story-time segment. You will hear web development anecdotes from people who have been through it all. You will enjoy interviews with engineer Neil Williams from Reddit, and engineer Chris Chew from Udacity. They will share their experiences on working with web applications, and you will see how all that you\u2019ve learned in this course comes into the big picture.\n\n###Final Project (8 hours)\nFor the final project, you will build a fully functional wiki - a website that allows any page to be edited. The wiki you will be able to build by the end of the course will feature the following: \n\n- Easily create new pages of the site by using the wiki edit capabilities. You should be able to enter a non-existent URL, redirect to an edit page, and create a new page from there. \n- Have user accounts so that logged-in users only will have edit privileges. \n- Use caching functionality.\n- Have a history section which displays the different wiki versions that have existed.",

If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.\n\n### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons?\n\n Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.\n\n### What are the rules on collaboration?\n\n Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. \n\n### Why are there so many questions?\n\n Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.\n\n### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos?\n\n Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

      "syllabus": "## Lesson 1: Overview\nIn this lesson you\u2019ll learn why accessibility matters, and who it affects. You\u2019ll also get a first look at the web accessibility guidelines (WAI \u2013 Web Accessibility Initiative), understand what \u201cPOUR\u201d means for accessibility, and locate checklists to help make your own sites accessible.\n\n## Lesson 2: Focus\nIn this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to make a page usable for anyone navigating with the keyboard. This starts with an introduction to the concept of focus (the element on the page to which keyboard events will be targeted), how to make elements focusable and when, and the order in which focusable elements will be traversed when exploring the page with the keyboard. You\u2019ll also learn how to manage focus in forms, in custom components, pop-ups, and off-screen content. \n\n## Lesson 3: Semantics Basics\nIn this lesson you\u2019ll build on keyboard navigation to make a page work for people who are unable to use a standard user interface, including users who can't see the screen. This requires ensuring assistive technology (such as screen readers) has sufficient information to present an alternative UI. You\u2019ll use a screen reader to try out ordinary form elements and add markup to make them work even better. You\u2019ll understand the accessibility tree the browser constructs from the DOM. Finally, you\u2019ll learn how to built-in HTML features to ensure the accessibility tree accurately reflects the visual UI. \n\n## Lesson 4: Semantics Extras\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll dive deeper into the screen-reader experience to add hyper-fast navigation. You\u2019ll learn how to arrange headings and label links so screen reader users can fly through your pages! You\u2019ll also learn how to call out \u201clandmarks\u201d into your page to speed up navigation even more. (As a bonus, this \u201csemantic markup\u201d  also makes your markup more readable!)\n\n## Lesson 5: Semantics - ARIA\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll move beyond the native elements of HTML into building custom controls and interactions. Of course you want these to be accessible, and that\u2019s where ARIA comes in \u2013 Accessible Rich Internet Applications. You\u2019ll learn how to add attributes to your custom interactions to make them as accessible as native elements. You\u2019ll also learn how to manage these attributes from Javascript as the user interacts with your page.\n\n## Lesson 6: Style\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll learn the third pillar of Accessibility (after Focus and Semantics): Styling. Your page\u2019s styles need to support highlighting the focus, indicating ARIA states, being zoomed in or out, and viewed by people with limited color or contrast vision. You\u2019ll learn how to audit your page with the Chrome Accessibility Tools and correct any styling issues that pop up, as well as designing with accessibility in mind.",

We\u2019ll then discuss closures, an often misunderstood but incredibly useful feature available in only a handful of languages, including JavaScript.\n\n### Lesson 2: The Keyword \u201cthis\u201d\nYou\u2019ll start your dive into JavaScript object-oriented features by first discovering the parameter \u201cthis\u201d. You\u2019ll learn how the value of \u201cthis\u201d is determined within various code structures and why it might be a lot easier to think of \u201cthis\u201d as a parameter rather than a keyword.\n\n### Lesson 3: Prototype Delegation\nYou\u2019re probably using one of JavaScript\u2019s inheritance models already: prototype delegation! In this lesson you\u2019ll learn more about this unique feature of JavaScript, how JavaScript uses this feature internally and how you can take advantage of it to maximize your application\u2019s memory footprint.\n\n### Lesson 4: Code Reuse\nThere are numerous ways to write concise, maintainable and reusable code in JavaScript and you\u2019ll practice a number of them in this lesson. We\u2019ll start writing a library using basic functions and learn the decorator pattern. Then, we\u2019ll refactor this library into the functional, prototypal and pseudoclassical inheritance models. Finally, we\u2019ll explore sub-classing -- coding objects that directly inherit from objects we\u2019ve previously defined.",

If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.\n\n### What are the rules on collaboration?\n\n Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. \n\n### Why are there so many questions?\n\n Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.\n\n### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos?\n\n Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

You'll meet the amazing instructors for the course and find out about the course structure and final project.\n\n### Lesson 2: R Basics (3 hours)\nEDA, which comes before formal hypothesis testing and modeling, makes use of visual methods to analyze and summarize data sets. R will be our tool for generating those visuals and conducting analyses. In this lesson, we will install RStudio and packages, learn the layout and basic commands of R, practice writing basic R scripts, and inspect data sets.\n\n### Lesson 3: Explore One Variable (4 hours)\nWe perform EDA to understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers. Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set as we begin to make sense of a pseudo-data set of Facebook users. While the data set does not contain real user data, it does contain a wealth of information. Through the lesson, we will create histograms and boxplots, transform variables, and examine tradeoffs in visualizations.\n\n### Problem Set 3 (2 hours)\n\n### Lesson 4: Explore Two Variables (4 hours)\nEDA allows us to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models. In this lesson, we will learn techniques for exploring the relationship between any two variables in a data set. We'll create scatter plots, calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means.\n\n### Problem Set 4 (2 hours)\n\n### Lesson 5: Explore Many Variables (4 hours)\nData sets can be complex. In this lesson, we will learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables. We'll learn how to reshape data frames and how to use aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information. Extending our knowledge of previous plots, we'll continue to build intuition around the Facebook data set and explore some new data sets as well.\n\n### Problem Set 5 (2 hours)\n\n### Lesson 6: Diamonds and Price Predictions (2 hours)\nInvestigate the diamonds data set alongside Facebook Data Scientist, Solomon Messing. He'll recap many of the strategies covered in the course and show how predictive modeling can allow us to determine a good price for a diamond. As a final project, you will create your own exploratory data analysis on a data set of your choice.\n\n### Final Project (10+ hours)\nYou've explored simulated Facebook user data and the diamonds data set. Now, it's your turn to conduct your own exploratory data analysis. Choose one data set to explore (one provided by Udacity or your own) and create a RMD file that uncovers the patterns, anomalies and relationships of the data set.",

In Lessons 1 and 2, you will learn widely applicable design principles and techniques like high-level UX planning and user-centered design.\n\nIn Lessons 3 and 4, you will focus on design ideas specific to mobile\/Android development. Mobile platforms all come with a unique set of constraints and opportunities and this lesson will help you respect those constraints while taking advantage of the opportunities. \n\n### Lessons\n\n#### Lesson 1: What is User Experience?\nIn this lesson you will think about User Experience from the highest level. You will break down complex apps into a small number of simple steps and think about their big picture flow (including ones that you have worked on in the past or are currently working on). \n\n*Topics covered:*\n\n* What is UX?\n* UI vs. UX\n* High-level planning\n* Low-fi wireframing and prototyping\n* Two concrete app improvements to implement now\n\n#### Lesson 2: User-Centered Design\nIn this lesson you will learn how to design apps that your users will love. You will learn the importance of user-centered design, what happens when you design for everyone\/no one (spoiler alert: it\u2019s generally bad), and how to effectively use tools like personas and use cases to ensure a baseline level of quality for anything you build. You will also learn a bit about how to use cheap and easy user research techniques to make well-informed design decisions. \n\n*Topics covered:*\n\n* The perils of ignoring your user\n* How to create effective personas and use cases\n* Low cost user research\n* How to use personas and use cases to inform feature lists\n\n#### Lesson 3: Designing for Mobile Constraints\n\nMobile design and development come with constraints and opportunities. This lesson is about the constraints. You will learn what constraints are inherent to mobile development and how to use design tools and techniques to ensure your app actually respects those constraints. \n\n*Topics covered:*\n\n* The 5 big constraints: limited data, finite battery, hand-held usage, divided user attention, and small screens.\n* The implications of these constraints and what happens when you get them wrong.\n* Advanced wireframing\n\n#### Lesson 4: Designing for Android Delight\n\nAt this point, you will already know how to make a solid mobile app that users like. But like isn\u2019t enough! In order to be really successful, your app needs to be *loved*. In this lesson, you\u2019ll learn how to leverage the power of Android by using device sensors and Google APIs to understand your user\u2019s context.\n\n*Topics covered:*\n\n* Android sensors\n* The importance of contextual apps\n* The \u201ccomponents\u201d of context\n* Android APIs (Google Play Services)\n\n### Final Project\nIn your final project, you will create high\/mid-level design specifications for your own incredible Android app. You'll begin work on this project in the Assignments for Lesson 2, and continue working on it until the end of the course. \n\nWhen it's finished, you will have the blueprint for an app that will:\n\n* Be designed for a specific target user.\n* Have an almost-perfect high level flow.\n* Avoid all major mobile pitfalls.\n* Use Android sensors and APIs to understand your user's context and deliver context-aware moments of amazement that they will love.",

      "syllabus": "### Overview\nIn this class you\u2019ll learn the basics of building apps with Force.com, a part of Salesforce Platform. These apps are typically business apps: they solve organizational and logistical problems. You probably wouldn\u2019t use Salesforce to build a computer game (though you could!).\n\nThere are two ways to build apps in Force.com: with or without code. This class will only cover the non-coding, point-and-click app building interface. But don\u2019t be fooled! Building powerful apps does not require writing code. \n\nThis class contains an introductory lesson, five primary lessons where you'll be building and learning (each of which has an accompanying problem set to practice your skills), and a final project where you'll put everything together.\n\n### Lesson 0: What is Salesforce (15 mins)\nWhat **is** Salesforce Platform? What does it do? Why should I learn about it? What kind of jobs can I get after I learn how to use it?\n\nIn this lesson, you\u2019ll meet the instructors, get to know the class, and learn a bit about Salesforce in general. \n\n### Lesson 1: Creating your First App (90 minutes)\nIn this lesson you\u2019ll get acquainted with Force.com and actually build the beginnings of your first app. You\u2019ll get some experience taking a big problem (in this case, managing a music festival), breaking it into smaller parts, and representing those parts in Salesforce. As you do this, you\u2019ll learn about the basic components of a Salesforce app and add some simple (but powerful) functionality to your app. More concretely, you\u2019ll learn about:\n\n* **Salesforce Data**: Salesforce represents data as objects, fields, and records. You\u2019ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app. \n* **Relationships**: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields. \n* **Validation Rules**: If you\u2019ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules. In this lesson, you\u2019ll learn how to build them into your app. \n* **Formulas and Summaries**: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent, customers contacted, or tickets sold. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to build these automated calculations into your app.  \n\n### Lesson 2: Building out your Data Model (90 mins)\nBehind every powerful business app is a well-planned data model (also known as a schema). In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to decompose a complex problem into its component pieces and then connect those pieces together with the appropriate relationship fields. The data model you build will serve as the schematic skeleton onto which you\u2019ll build dynamic functionality in later lessons. The specific topics covered are: \n\n* **One-to-Many Relationships**: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build. \n* **Many-to-Many Relationships**: You\u2019ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model. \n* **Customizing the User Interface**: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive.\n* **Schema Builder**: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson you\u2019ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works.\n* **Data Loading**: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once.\n\n### Lesson 3: Visualizing your Data (45 mins) \nNo matter what kind of app you\u2019re building, you\u2019ve probably got some data that you want other people in your organization to understand quickly and easily. In this lesson you\u2019ll learn how quickly communicate information with  real-time data visualizations. Specifically, you\u2019ll learn how to make:\n\n* **Reports**: These let you gather related information into one place.  These let you gather data according to specific criteria and display it in neat rows and columns. \n* **Charts**: These let you graphically summarize the information in a report.\n* **Dashboards**: Different people want access to different information. A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time.\n* **Views**: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much. Views let you selectively and quickly display only the data you care about.\n\n### Lesson 4: Adding Automation (45 mins)\nIn this lesson you\u2019ll think about how to use your app to automate manual tasks. You\u2019ll learn how to use two important Salesforce tools: \n\n* **Workflows**: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this, then do that. Workflows let you automate processes like these, such as sending an email, assigning a task, or updating a field.\n* **Approval Processes**: You don\u2019t want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say \u201cthis looks good.\u201d Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks.\n\n### Lesson 5: Make it Social. Make it Mobile. (45 mins)\nThis is it. With a few clicks of the mouse you\u2019ll make your app social and mobile. The tools you\u2019ll use are:\n\n* **Chatter**: This will let your users collaborate on the projects and records they work on together.  \n* **Salesforce1**: That web app you\u2019ve been building this whole time? It\u2019s actually a mobile app too. You\u2019ll even learn how to quickly customize your mobile interface and add functionality for mobile productivity. \n\n### Final Project: Build your own App (2-4 hours)\nBy the time you get here, you will have already built a music festival management app. Now it\u2019s time to take your own idea and turn it into a functional web and mobile app.",

Lesson 6 will be a short intro on an easy way to create native mobile apps that talk to your backend.\n\n###Lesson 1: Scalability Basics\nDo you know how and why server racks were invented years ago? Have you realized all of the problems that you have to solve if you will try to scale your app by yourself? Learn about a better way.\n\n###Lesson 2: Getting Started\nSet up your first App Engine project and learn how to define Cloud Endpoints. \n\nStart the course project app - Conference Central and add authentication and user profiles.\n\n###Lesson 3: Storing and Retrieving Data\nOne of the most important things you want to do in your app is storing data. In this lesson you will learn what is Google App Engine Datastore, how is it different from RDBMS and how you can use it in your applications.\n\nAdd the ability to store and retrieve user profiles and conferences to the course project app.\n\n###Lesson 4: Advanced Datastore Concepts\nLearn more about how Datastore works, including queries, filters, indexes and transactions. \n\nAdd different ways to query conferences.\n\n###Lesson 5: Advanced App Engine Topics\nThere are a lot of things you might want your application to do in background, without making the user wait, or even initiate the process. Learn about task queues and cron jobs and how you can use them to add advanced functionality to your app. You will also learn about Memcache, and get an overview of topics like Edge Caching, AppStats and other methods of optimising your apps performance.\n\nAdd a push queue, cron job and a customised Memcache entry to your app.\n\n###Lesson 6: App Engine and Mobile Apps\nYou have been using Cloud Endpoints in the app, and now it\u2019s time to see how you can use them in a mobile app. Learn how to generate native libraries for Android and iOS that can talk to your backend. You can even recompile the Android app we provide with our course, to work against your own project. How cool is that?\n\nGenerate mobile client libraries for your app.",

In this model, each serial RAM\u2019s memory is private to the other RAMs; consequently, the processors must coordinate and communicate by sending and receiving messages.\n\nSub-topics include:\n\n** The basic algorithmic model\n** Intro to the Message Passing Interface, a practical programming model\n** Reasoning about the effects of network topology\n** Dense linear algebra\n** Sorting\n** Sparse graph algorithms\n** Graph partitioning\n\n* Unit 3: Two-level memory or I\/O models\n\nIn this model, we return to a serial RAM, but instead of having only a processor connected to a main memory, there is a smaller but faster scratchpad memory in between the two.

This course focuses on theoretical underpinnings. To give a practical feeling for how algorithms map to and behave on real systems, we will supplement algorithmic theory with hands-on exercises on modern HPC systems, such as Cilk Plus or OpenMP on shared memory nodes, CUDA for graphics co-processors (GPUs), and MPI and PGAS models for distributed memory systems.\n\nThis course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. \u201cScale\u201d really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way you\u2019ve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques you\u2019ll need to do so.\n\nThe techniques you\u2019ll encounter covers the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and many core shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others. The practical aspect of this course is implementing the algorithms and techniques you\u2019ll learn to run on real parallel and distributed systems, so you can check whether what appears to work well in theory also translates into practice.

      "syllabus": "###Lesson 1: The US Healthcare System\nThis lesson will discuss unique and the complex nature of the US healthcare system: its key problems, the specific challenges presented by chronic disease, the major disconnect between the health system\u2019s capabilities and the demands of chronic disease management, and the hope that a combination of new incentives, health IT adoption, and new models of care can bridge this disconnect leading to a more efficient, effective, safer and more patient-centered US system of care.\n###Lesson 2: Federal Policies & Initiatives\nThis lesson will focus on the important details of the specific programs that the federal government has put into place to spur health IT adoption by eligible providers and hospitals as well as the role played by financial incentives that reward performance, rather than the quantity of procedures. \n###Lesson 3: Health Information Exchange\nThis lesson will focus on the rationale for and the major challenges of health information exchange (HIE). We will discuss the various ways of classifying HIE, how to differentiate the various HIE architectures, and the Indiana Health Information Exchange as a premier example including descriptions of its key services. We will discuss new approaches and technologies with a particular emphasis on Direct HIE, a new technology based on secure email and encrypted attachments.\n###Lesson 4: Privacy, Security and Trust\nThis lesson focuses on the keys issues of privacy, security, and trust in a world of digital records and health information exchange. Students will understand the key role that patient engagement plays in chronic disease prevention and management and the concerns patients have about sharing their health data. They will also explore the various privacy consent models. Data segmentation will be discussed as a key challenge for obtaining patient consent under what may be the most acceptable model. The concept of public key infrastructure (PKI) including the roles of the public key, private key, registration authority and certificate authority will be covered.\n###Lesson 5A: Data Standards\nWe divide the discussion of standards into those for health data and those for achieving its sharing by fostering interoperability. This lesson  focuses on data standards after reviewing the rationale for standards and the evolutions that have been taking place in their use, technology and structure. Students will be able to recognize the difference between a classification and an ontology.  They will be familiar with the key data standards (including ICD, CPT, LOINC and SNOMED). They will also gain an overview of the differences between standards based on EDI\/X12 and XML.\n###Lesson 5B: Interoperability Standards\nThis lesson builds on Lesson 5A on data standards to show how these data are transmitted within messages using HL7 and packaged into CCDA-based clinical documents for sharing via HIE. We\u2019ll briefly introduce even more advanced standards with a particular emphasis on clinical decision support (CDS, an important technology for the future) and the key elements of and remaining challenges with standards to support CDS. We\u2019ll also discuss more facile next generation approaches based on web technologies and approaches. \n###Lesson 6: Clinical Data Collection and Visualization Challenges\nStudents should understand the key roles that data plays in medical practice and the root causes of common data quality issues in general and the specific root causes of data quality issues with respect to electronic health records. They should understand the high level challenges of efficiently and accurately collecting high quality, comprehensive clinical data from physicians and of visualizing digital health data in a way that supports the provider\u2019s mental model. They should understand the key roles that information technology plays in the future vision of healthcare.\n###Lesson 7: Empowering the Patient\nStudents should understand the key role that support for patients can play so they can achieve behavior change, adhere to their prescribed treatments and generate data to help their providers more continuously manage their chronic diseases. They should understand patient interests. They should understand the key information technology tools now available to patients including patient health records, portals, social networking, in home technologies and mobile devices and sensors. They should have a detailed functional understanding of personal health records and their potential as app platforms. They should understand the potential role of social networking in patient education and care management. They should understand the various telemedicine modalities being developed and offered for use by patients at home.\n###Lesson 8: Population Health Management\nStudents should understand the difference between individual patient management, population management and public health. They should understand the technologies for aggregating data, the kinds of data that are collected and the kinds of reports that are required for population and public health management.\n###Lesson 9: Data Query in a Federated Environment\nStudents should understand the challenges of data query and aggregation in an environment where care providers are using disparate and non-interoperable EHRs. They should be familiar with and understand the differences among the distributed query technologies. They should be familiar with the distributed query standards and the various open source query frameworks reviewed in this lesson.\n###Lesson 10: Big Data Meets Healthcare\nStudents should understand the concept of \u201cbig data\u201d; the common technical approaches to modeling and simulation and the common applications of each. They should be familiar with the specific case studies of analytic applications to healthcare problems as diverse as improved clinical decision support, understanding clinical processes, modeling care spaces and providing optimal patient-specific treatments.",

A detailed study of the perceptual, technical and computational aspects of forming pictures, and more precisely the capture and depiction of reality on a (mostly 2D) medium of images is undertaken over the entire term. The scientific, perceptual, and artistic principles behind image-making will be emphasized, especially as impacted and changed by computation.\n\nTopics include the relationship between pictorial techniques and the human visual system; intrinsic limitations of 2D representations and their possible compensations; and technical issues involving capturing light to form images. Technical aspects of image capture and rendering, and exploration of how such a medium can be used to its maximum potential, will be examined. New forms of cameras and imaging paradigms will be introduced.",

All algorithms work perfectly in the slides. But remember what [Yogi Berra](http:\/\/yogiberramuseum.org\/just-for-fun\/yogisms\/) said: In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is. (Einstein said something similar but who knows more about real life?)

This lesson will show you how to use the Chrome Developer Tools to develop for the mobile web.\n\n### Lesson 03: Mobile UX and Viewport\nDesigning for the mobile web is all about a smooth user experience. This lesson will get you thinking about how to achieve that on mobile, and we\u2019ll introduce the first of many tools you need to achieve this: the viewport.\n\n### Lesson 04: Fluid Design\nMobile means lots of different devices and form factors. We\u2019ll discuss how to make your site responsive, clean, and user-friendly on multiple devices and layouts.\n\n### Lesson 05: Media Queries\nSometimes different devices call for fundamentally different layouts. This lesson will teach you how to achieve this using media queries.\n\n### Lesson 06: Responsive Images\nMedia requirements are different in mobile - network constraints and very high resolution screens set up a conflict that can be challenging.  We\u2019ll talk about how best to integrate media into your mobile web applications, and adaptively scaling images based on the environment.\n\n### Lesson 07: Optimizing Performance\nUsers expect a fast, seamless experience on mobile. We\u2019ll go over optimizing various performance metrics to improve that experience, such as network, cpu, rendering, and battery performance.\n\n### Lesson 08: Touch\nTouch input is fundamentally different from mouse input, and requires you to think about your user interactions differently. We\u2019ll go over UX concerns with touch-based interaction, and how to design user interactions that work across devices.\n\n### Lesson 09: Input\nUsing a keyboard on mobile is awful. We\u2019ll discuss ways to improve it, using semantic input for form data, and other user input options on mobile.\n\n### Lesson 10: Device Access\nMobile devices have a full array of sensors typically unavailable on desktop.

Before diving into optimizations, you\u2019ll build an understanding of how browsers convert HTML, CSS and JavaScript into websites. Along the way, you\u2019ll practice measuring performance using the same tools Google engineers use.\n\nThen comes the really fun part: optimization! You\u2019ll learn about easy-to-implement performance gains and develop a simple and powerful model for uncovering optimization opportunities.\n\nYou\u2019ll put your newfound performance skillset to the test with the final project, where you\u2019ll be optimizing your own online portfolio website!\n\n##Lessons\n###Lesson 0 (20 minutes)\nYou can\u2019t optimize what you can\u2019t measure, so in this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to open Chrome Developer Tools to measure the performance of mobile and desktop websites.\n\n###Lesson 1 (60 minutes)\nOptimizing any website\u2019s performance requires a strong understanding of how browsers build websites from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You\u2019ll start by breaking down the **Critical Rendering Path** - the steps the browser has to take to render a page. You\u2019ll get an understanding of how:\n\n* **HTML** is converted to the **Document Object Model (DOM)**.\n* **CSS** is converted to the **CSS Object Model (CSSOM)**.\n* the browser runs **layout** to determine the position and size of elements before **painting** pixels on the screen.\n\nThroughout the lesson, you\u2019ll learn how to take advantage of the Timeline view in **Chrome Developer Tools** to measure each and every step\u2019s performance on mobile and desktop.\n\n###Lesson 2 (90 minutes)\nYou\u2019ll explore easy HTML, CSS and JavaScript optimizations with significant performance implications, some of which are as simple as adding a single attribute to an HTML tag! Along the way, you\u2019ll be developing the skills to help you diagnose opportunities for optimizations, including:\n\n* building **quick and dirty** diagrams of the Critical Rendering Path.\n* identifying **three key metrics** to triangulate potential performance bottlenecks.",

You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. \n\n### Why are there so many questions?\n\n Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.\n\n### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos?\n\n Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.\n\n### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons?\n\n Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\u2019re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.\n\n### How much does this cost?\n\n It\u2019s completely free! If you\u2019re feeling generous, we would love to have you contribute your thoughts, questions, and answers to the course discussion forum.\n\n### What are the rules on collaboration?\n\n Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. \n\n### Why are there so many questions?\n\n Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.\n\n### What should I do while I\u2019m watching the videos?\n\n Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.",

You\u2019ll also learn the key components used in time series forecasting, such as seasonality, trends, and cyclical patterns.\n\n###Lesson 2 \u2013 ETS Models\nIn this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to build and use ETS models. ETS stands for error, trend, and seasonality, and are the three inputs in ETS models. You\u2019ll learn how to use time series decomposition plots to visualize each of these components. Then you\u2019ll get hands on practice building out an ETS model in Alteryx.\n \n###Lesson 3 \u2013 ARIMA Models\nIn this lesson you\u2019ll learn how to build and use ARIMA models. ARIMA stands for autoregressive, integrated, moving average, which are the inputs for ARIMA models. You\u2019ll learn how to stationarize data through differencing, a process that prepares data for ARIMA modeling. You\u2019ll learn the different techniques used in seasonal and non-seasonal ARIMAs. Then you\u2019ll get hands on practice building out an ARIMA model in Alteryx.\n \n###Lesson 4 \u2013 Analyzing and Visualizing Results\nThis lesson will demonstrate how to interpret the various results from time series models. You\u2019ll learn how to use holdout samples to compare models and select the best one for a business problem. You\u2019ll also learn how to visualize your forecasts through various plots.",

We will discuss the various ways of classifying HIE, how to differentiate the various HIE architectures, and the Indiana Health Information Exchange as a premier example including descriptions of its key services. We will discuss new approaches and technologies with a particular emphasis on Direct HIE, a new technology based on secure email and encrypted attachments.\n##Lesson 4: Privacy, Security and Trust\nThis lesson focuses on the keys issues of privacy, security, and trust in a world of digital records and health information exchange. Students will understand the key role that patient engagement plays in chronic disease prevention and management and the concerns patients have about sharing their health data. They will also explore the various privacy consent models. Data segmentation will be discussed as a key challenge for obtaining patient consent under what may be the most acceptable model. The concept of public key infrastructure (PKI) including the roles of the public key, private key, registration authority and certificate authority will be covered.\n##Lesson 5A: Data Standards\nWe divide the discussion of standards into those for health data and those for achieving its sharing by fostering interoperability. This lesson  focuses on data standards after reviewing the rationale for standards and the evolutions that have been taking place in their use, technology and structure. Students will be able to recognize the difference between a classification and an ontology.  They will be familiar with the key data standards (including ICD, CPT, LOINC and SNOMED). They will also gain an overview of the differences between standards based on EDI\/X12 and XML.\n##Lesson 5B: Interoperability Standards\nThis lesson builds on Lesson 5A on data standards to show how these data are transmitted within messages using HL7 and packaged into CCDA-based clinical documents for sharing via HIE. We\u2019ll briefly introduce even more advanced standards with a particular emphasis on clinical decision support (CDS, an important technology for the future) and the key elements of and remaining challenges with standards to support CDS. We\u2019ll also discuss more facile next generation approaches based on web technologies and approaches. \n##Lesson 6: Clinical Data Collection and Visualization Challenges\nStudents should understand the key roles that data plays in medical practice and the root causes of common data quality issues in general and the specific root causes of data quality issues with respect to electronic health records. They should understand the high level challenges of efficiently and accurately collecting high quality, comprehensive clinical data from physicians and of visualizing digital health data in a way that supports the provider\u2019s mental model. They should understand the key roles that information technology plays in the future vision of healthcare.\n##Lesson 7: Empowering the Patient\nStudents should understand the key role that support for patients can play so they can achieve behavior change, adhere to their prescribed treatments and generate data to help their providers more continuously manage their chronic diseases. They should understand patient interests. They should understand the key information technology tools now available to patients including patient health records, portals, social networking, in home technologies and mobile devices and sensors. They should have a detailed functional understanding of personal health records and their potential as app platforms. They should understand the potential role of social networking in patient education and care management. They should understand the various telemedicine modalities being developed and offered for use by patients at home.\n##Lesson 8: Population Health Management\nStudents should understand the difference between individual patient management, population management and public health. They should understand the technologies for aggregating data, the kinds of data that are collected and the kinds of reports that are required for population and public health management.\n##Lesson 9: Data Query in a Federated Environment\nStudents should understand the challenges of data query and aggregation in an environment where care providers are using disparate and non-interoperable EHRs. They should be familiar with and understand the differences among the distributed query technologies. They should be familiar with the distributed query standards and the various open source query frameworks reviewed in this lesson.\n##Lesson 10: Big Data Meets Healthcare\nStudents should understand the concept of \u201cbig data\u201d; the common technical approaches to modeling and simulation and the common applications of each. They should be familiar with the specific case studies of analytic applications to healthcare problems as diverse as improved clinical decision support, understanding clinical processes, modeling care spaces and providing optimal patient-specific treatments.",

Please view the prerequisites in more detail in our Nanodegree Overview Page. \n\nI'm already enrolled in the Data Analyst Nanodegree program. Can I switch to the new content and pricing structure? \n\nAbsolutely! If you are a currently enrolled student and would like more information about making the switch, simply write into dataanalyst-support@udacity.com and we will be happy to assist you. \n\n##TUITION\/PAYMENTS\n\n###How much does the Data Analyst Nanodegree program cost?\n\nThe full program consists of two(2) three-month long Terms at a cost of $499 for each Term, for a total program cost of $998. If you start the Nanodegree program at the Term 2 level, then the total program cost is $499. When you enroll, you\u2019ll self-select your starting point as either Term 1 or Term 2, depending on your current skills and experience.\n\n###Is there a free trial period for this program?\n\nThere is no free trial period for this program, but there is a 7-day refund guarantee in place at the beginning of each Term.\n\n###Are graduates of the Data Analyst Nanodegree program eligible for the 50% tuition refund offer?\n\nData Analyst Nanodegree program graduates are not eligible to receive this tuition refund upon completion of their studies.\n\n###Are there scholarships or financial aid available?\n\nWe do not currently offer scholarships for the Data Analyst Nanodegree program but we are always looking for partnership opportunities for scholarship development, so please check back often!\n \n##PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND DEADLINES\n \n###How is this Nanodegree program structured?\n\nThe Data Analyst Nanodegree program is comprised of two (2) Terms of three (3) months each. Each Term has fixed start and end dates. When you enroll, you\u2019ll self-select your starting point as either Term 1 or Term 2, depending on your current skills and experience. \n\nStudents must successfully complete Term 2 to graduate. There are 3 projects per term, which give you an opportunity to apply the skills you\u2019ve learned in the lessons. Each project will be reviewed by one of the expert project reviewers in the Udacity reviewer network. Your reviewer will give you detailed feedback on your work and let you know where your project needs improvement if necessary. If you do not pass the project, you will be asked to submit again until you pass in order to successfully complete the term.\n\n###Do you offer the opportunity for students to pause their studies for this program?\n\nNo. The fixed-term nature of the Data Analyst Nanodegree program, and the need for maintaining a consistent and stable student body throughout, doesn\u2019t allow for offering the option to pause your studies.\n\n###What if I enroll into the wrong term and need to switch to another term?\n\nWe highly recommend all students read through the syllabus and prerequisites before choosing the term. If you choose a term and decide that you are either under-prepared or over-prepared for the term of your choice, please write to support@udacity.com within the 7-day refund guarantee period and we will assist you in making the switch to the right term. After the 7-day refund guarantee period is over we will not be able to process your request. \n \n###Is this program self-paced?\n\nNo. The start and end dates of each Term are fixed, and you must complete all assigned projects by the end dates. However, projects may be submitted at any time during a Term, and individual project deadlines are recommendations, not requirements. So within a Term, there is some opportunity to work at your own pace. You should plan to follow our recommended timeline, as this will best enable you to keep pace with your peers, and complete the program on time.\n\n###When can I receive a certificate for completing the Data Analyst Nanodegree program?\n\nUpon successful completion of Term 2 of the program, students will be granted a certificate. Students who complete only Term 1 of the program will need to enroll into Term 2 and complete the course before receiving a certificate. If students choose to enroll in Term 2 only and pass all projects, they are still eligible for a certificate even if they have not completed Term 1. \n\n###What are my options if I don't complete the Term by the deadline? \n\nIn order to graduate a term, you must submit all projects by the last day of the term and pass all projects once they are reviewed by a Udacity Reviewer (the review may take place after the last day of the term). Passing a project means a Udacity Reviewer has marked a project as \u201cMeets Specifications.\u201d \n\nIf you do not submit all projects by the end of the term and also pass all projects once they are reviewed: You will receive a 4-week extension to complete any outstanding projects. You will only receive this extension a maximum of once. If you are in Term 1 and want to join Term 2 next, you can enroll in the next term, which will potentially be with a later class. If you do not submit and pass all projects within the 4-week extension, you will be removed from the program. \n\n###What kind of weekly time commitment should I expect?\n\nOn average, we find students spending 10 hours per week throughout the entire term, in order to complete this program on time. This is an average, so some students may require more than the allotted time frame, or less. \n\n##OTHER\n\n###Are deferments an option if I'm enrolled, but not ready to start yet?\n\nNo, deferments are not an option. We ask that you please make sure to only enroll for a term if you are able to commit to the entire time frame.\n\n###Is this program available internationally?\n\nAll eligible students, according to our Terms of Service, are welcome to enroll in the English-language version of this program.

      "syllabus": "## What You Will Build\n\nAs you progress through this Nanodegree you will document what you're learning in a web page that you'll build as you go. By the end you will have a fully-functioning web page and some cool programs that demonstrate what you've learned, like how to:\n\n### Look Professional\nBy using a \"styling\" language called CSS, you will be able to quickly and easily change the look and feel of your web page. While learning CSS, you'll also gain experience with one of the most important concepts in computer science: avoiding repetition through something called *abstraction*. \n\n### Display Videos\nIn addition to your own notes about what you're learning, you'll learn to write computer code in a language called Python that will embed your favorite videos (from Udacity or anywhere else) directly onto a web page. While learning  Python, you'll be developing a skill that's required for every programming project regardless of language: using procedural thinking to tell a computer exactly what you want it to do.\n\n\n### Be User-Friendly\nEven though *you* will have the skills to modify your web page by changing the code it's made from, the people you show it to may not. You'll add a form that allows visitors to add their own content to your page (if you let them of course). While you're learning what to do with information that someone submits to your web page, you'll also gain a deeper understanding for how the internet works and how computer programmers assemble complex programs by combining pieces of computer code that others have written before them. \n\n## How You Will Learn to Build it\n\nThis Nanodegree consists of a series of 5 stages. In each one, you will learn new broadly-applicable technical skills. After each stage, you will complete a project checkpoint, then submit your work for valuable feedback on your progress.  \n\n### Stage 1: Make Your Web Page\nYou will learn the basics of how the internet works and how documents written in a language called HTML form the backbone of the Web. In the **project checkpoint** at the end you'll *write HTML and CSS (another language) to make your web page look professional.*\n\n### Stage 2: Code Your Own Quiz\nThis is where you'll learn how to program. You'll learn a programming language called Python and you'll use it to write instructions that the computer can understand and execute. After this stage you will have incredible power: you will be able to automate almost any repetitive task that can be done on a computer. In the **project checkpoint** you will *write a program in Python to build a fill-in-the blanks type quiz.*\n\n### Stage 3: Create a Movie Website\nIn this stage, you will learn an entirely new approach to programming (and thinking) called Object Oriented Programming and how to use this approach to build impressive programs by simply reusing or modifying computer code that others have already written. In the **project checkpoint** you will create a simple movies webpage with images and trailers.*\n\n### Stage 4: Allow Comments\nUp to this point, you still haven't put your web page online: you've only seen it on your own computer. In this stage, you will gain a deeper understanding for how the internet works and will write code which tells computers called \"servers\" how to display web pages. In the **project checkpoint** you will *put your web page online and build what's called a \"back end\" which will allow people anywhere in the world to view and--if you let them--modify your site.*\n\n### Stage 5: Choose Your Next Steps\nAt this point, you will already have a solid understanding of most of the essential concepts and skills that programming requires. This stage will be a rapid sampling of some of the ideas that you haven't seen including:\n\n* **JavaScript**: the language of the web.\n* **APIs**: \"Application Programming Interfaces\" give programmers a way to easily incorporate data from all over the web into their applications.\n* **Recursion**: This may be the most mind-blowing idea in programming.\n* **Parallel Computing**: How to use many computers to solve really big problems more efficiently.\n* **How to Solve Big Problems**: You run into new challenges when you write large programs (or building substantial web pages). \n* **Responsive Web Design**: How to make your web page look good on a computer, tablet, or phone.\n\nIn the **project checkpoint** you will have the chance to *pursue one of these ideas even deeper by adding new functionality (you get to choose what) to your web page.*",
