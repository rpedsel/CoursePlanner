This course will enrich your resume, open up new business opportunities and it will allow you to change or expand your field of specialization. \n\nDevelopers will learn about localization basics and gain an understanding of how to launch applications and products in international markets. This course will also shed light on the potential challenges and issues you might run into, while providing known solutions, and which stakeholders need to be involved in a product launch to make it internationally successful.\n\nEntrepreneurs and business owners will understand why localization is important for the international expansion and success of their companies, also learning which professionals their companies need to rely on, which technologies to use and how to organize localization processes to launch successful products globally. So, what is localization? In the world of information technology, localization means translating and adapting a product or service to a particular language, culture, and geographic market.\n\nThere are two main aspects to localization. The first one is stylistic: You have to make sure the language tone you use is appropriate for each local culture. There\u2019s also a technical aspect: You may have to make changes to things like date and time formats, alphabetization, or even the direction of reading, to make them appropriate for the language you\u2019re localizing into. So localization means more than just translating a message or text, it\u2019s about making a whole product feel tailored to users everywhere. \n\nThis need for localized content has made the language industry the 4th fastest growing industry in the world with a global size of an estimated $40 billion. More people across the globe are coming online, and they need to be able to use technology in a language they understand. That\u2019s what localization is all about.",

This course dives into the why and how of making web applications accessible. As a bonus, accessible sites also tend to be more usable for everybody! In this course you\u2019ll get hands-on experience making web applications accessible. You\u2019ll understand when and why users need accessibility. Then you\u2019ll dive into the \u201chow\u201d: making a page work properly with screen readers, and managing input focus (e.g. the highlight you see when tabbing through a form.) You\u2019ll understand what \u201csemantics\u201d and \u201csemantic markup\u201d mean for web pages and add ARIA markup to enable a range of assistive devices.  Finally, you\u2019ll learn styling techniques that help users with partial vision navigate the your pages easily and reliability.",

    "description":"This course provides an introduction to topics that often show up on technical interviews. It is aimed at students who have never taken a course in algorithms and data structures, but want to learn the material. It can also be used to refresh on these topics for those who have seen them before. In addition to video explanations, there are plenty of examples and discussions of the intricacies of different approaches.\n\nThis course is distinct from other similar offerings on Udacity. It is a precursor to the \u201cIntro to Algorithms\u201d course, and complimentary to the Interviewing Course listed in most career-focused Nanodegrees. This course is focused on explaining the technical content that show up in interviews, while the other course is more centered on behavioral questions and how to act in an interview. Are you ready to conquer your next interview? To succeed, you need to understand the expectations. \nVirtually all technical interviews follow a very set pattern: you get asked a very specific type of question, you're required to have very specific knowledge, and you're expected to answer\u2014and interact with your interviewer\u2014in a very particular way. Knowing this in advance, and preparing accordingly, is the key to success. \n\nThis course was designed to give you what you need to ace a technical interview. Included are:\n\n - videos that walk you through the algorithms and data structures concepts commonly asked in technical interviews\n - an explanation of efficiency, and an explanation of how it relates to topics covered throughout the class\n - practice problems and quizzes to test your understanding\n - a mock interview with a breakdown explaining how interviewers expect you to explain your thought process\n - curated links to outside resources, including a special link to live practice interviewing with other Udacity students on Pramp \n - if you\u2019re a Nanodegree student, a final project where you can answer interview questions and get feedback from a trained reviewer.\n\nThe goal of this course is to prepare you for a real technical interview, so we focus on the material you'll actually be expected to do.",

    "description":"As your software projects get more ambitious, the process of building and deploying your apps will become more and more involved. However, modern software development requires rapid iterative releases, known as continuous delivery. Gradle is a next-generation build automation system that makes continuous delivery of complex projects a reality.\n\nGradle supports many languages and tools, and is tightly integrated with Android Studio. This course is useful for any developer seeking to understand Gradle, but focuses on Android builds. The default Android build settings are enough to put a simple debug app on your phone, but to build an app that's ready for the Google Play Store, you'll need to understand your build process and how to customize it. This course explores how the Gradle build tool compiles and packages apps, and you'll learn to customize the build process. The first half of this course is for anyone interested in Gradle, build automation, and continuous delivery of software.\n\nThe latter half of the course reveals the magic that happens after you hit the \"Run\" button in Android Studio. You'll also explore advanced Android topics, learning to configure free vs paid app flavors, create and integrate Android libraries, test your app, and prepare your app for the Play Store.",

    "description":"Many wonderful games make appearances in the app stores, and while often well-built, aesthetically appealing, and rewarding to play, they generally come and go before you know it. Genuine and sustainable monetization is necessary for your game to be successful over the long-term. \n\nThe skills you learn in this course will enable you to pursue and implement the most effective monetization strategies for your game, build a game that keeps your players interested and engaged, and present your game in  ways that allow it to stand out in the app store. \n\nYou will also learn how to program and use mobile ads in your game. At first it may seem strange to consider monetization before a game is even completed, and many developers leave this as an afterthought. But monetization should be built into the fabric of a game from the beginning, because a clearly defined and understood monetization strategy can have tremendous impact on design decisions made during the development process. This kind of forward-thinking approach is especially important in today\u2019s highly competitive game market, and keeping monetization strategy front-of-mind throughout can be the difference between product success and failure. \n\nThis course will teach you how to make your game stand out in a very crowded field, and encourage people to pay for game features that will define the ultimate success of your product.\n\nCurrently, most game apps are free to play, and many users are looking for something simple and entertaining without the risk of making a purchase. We'll look at the most successful premium and freemium games, and discuss the most effective strategies for monetization.

Developers build their applications using reliable internet and fast computers. They experience their own creations in an ideal environment, and they are almost always thinking online-first. But if you are truly focused on user experience, you need to understand how your applications perform in all scenarios. This is why it is critical to build applications that are offline-first.\n\nIn order to build applications that look and feel good ALL the time\u2014not just in the best of cases\u2014you need to do more than just learn new techniques and tools, you need to change your approach and way of thinking. This course will help you do just that. This course is focused squarely on user experience, and seeks to show developers how thinking offline-first is the best way to ensure that applications perform their best in all scenarios, not just ideal ones. You'll learn to recognize the differences between good, poor, intermittent, and missing connectivity for your users , and master  how to make applications that navigate these conditions with ease.\n\nUsing the skills you master in this course, you'll conclude by building an app that that works both online and offline, and loads in new data when it can. You'll be a master of the cache! Your web apps will interact with the network just like native apps do.

Over the course of six lessons, you will build a blog together with Steve that will be fully functional, online, for anybody to read by the end of the course. \n\n- Have you ever wondered how a  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki\" target=\"_blank\">wiki</a> works? As a final project for this course, you will be able to take all of your newly gained knowledge and apply it to build a complete wiki. \n\nThis course concentrates on back-end development, but regardless if you are interested in front-end development, back-end development, or anywhere in between the stack, this course will teach you the fundamental knowledge you need break into the web development world. Are you ready to dive in? Try to picture yourself sitting down with your computer, ready to start developing a fully functional web application for the first time, available online for millions to use. \u201cWhere should I even begin? How long is this going to take me? Am I making any mistakes along the way?\u201d The questions may leave you with an uneasy feeling that you will learn many lessons the hard way. \n\nIn this intermediate course, Steve Huffman will teach you everything he wished he knew when he started building <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit</a> and, more recently, <a href=\"http://www.hipmunk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hipmunk</a>, as a lead engineer. Starting from the basics of how the web works, this course will walk you through core web development concepts such as how internet and browsers fit together, form validations, databases, APIs, integrating with other websites, scaling issues, and more; all of which form part of the knowledge it takes to build a web application of your own.",

We have provided the frontend of the app, and all your effort will go into making the backend.\n\nAnd because you will be using Cloud Endpoints, it\u2019s really easy to hook up your backend with a native mobile app. We have created an Android app that uses the same backend as the web frontend. You will able to recompile it against your backend, if you so wish!\n\nAt the end of the course you will do a final project, where you will have to expand the functionality of the same app. You will learn about challenges of building applications that can serve hundreds of thousands of users, and how you can prepare for them as a developer. And more importantly - you will learn how to harness the power of **App Engine** - Platform as a Service, run by Google, so you can focus on your application's features, not on managing infrastructure that runs your app. Let Google run and scale the infrastructure and do what you do best - write code! \n\nHowever, to use App Engine effectively, you have to learn how it works, and this is exactly what this course will teach! You will also learn the best practices of using <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/cloud-endpoints/\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud Endpoints</a> that allow you to easily create RESTful services and make them accessible to iOS, Android and Javascript clients.

    "description":" The goal of this course is to give you solid foundations for developing, analyzing, and implementing parallel and locality-efficient algorithms. This course focuses on theoretical underpinnings. To give a practical feeling for how algorithms map to and behave on real systems, we will supplement algorithmic theory with hands-on exercises on modern HPC systems, such as Cilk Plus or OpenMP on shared memory nodes, CUDA for graphics co-processors (GPUs), and MPI and PGAS models for distributed memory systems.\n\nThis course is a graduate-level introduction to scalable parallel algorithms. \u201cScale\u201d really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes) grows. To really scale your algorithm in both of these senses, you need to be smart about reducing asymptotic complexity the way you\u2019ve done for sequential algorithms since CS 101; but you also need to think about reducing communication and data movement. This course is about the basic algorithmic techniques you\u2019ll need to do so.\n\nThe techniques you\u2019ll encounter covers the main algorithm design and analysis ideas for three major classes of machines: for multicore and many core shared memory machines, via the work-span model; for distributed memory machines like clusters and supercomputers, via network models; and for sequential or parallel machines with deep memory hierarchies (e.g., caches). You will see these techniques applied to fundamental problems, like sorting, search on trees and graphs, and linear algebra, among others. The practical aspect of this course is implementing the algorithms and techniques you\u2019ll learn to run on real parallel and distributed systems, so you can check whether what appears to work well in theory also translates into practice.

Many examples we will attempt may not have one correct answer but will require you to work through the problems applying the methods we hope to illustrate throughout this class. This course will teach you how to start from scratch in answering questions about the real world using data. Machine learning happens to be a small part of this process. The model building process involves setting up ways of collecting data, understanding and paying attention to what is important in the data to answer the questions you are asking, finding a statistical, mathematical or a simulation model to gain understanding and make predictions. \n\nAll of these things are equally important and model building is a crucial skill to acquire in every field of science. The process stays true to the scientific method, making what you learn through your models useful for gaining an understanding of whatever you are investigating as well as make predictions that hold true to test. \n\nWe will take you on a journey through building various models. This process involves asking questions, gathering and manipulating data, building models, and ultimately testing and evaluating them.",

Taking this course here will not earn credit towards the OMS degree.</i>\n\nMachine Learning is a graduate-level course covering the area of Artificial Intelligence concerned with computer programs that modify and improve their performance through experiences. \n\nThe first part of the course covers Supervised Learning, a machine learning task that makes it possible for your phone to recognize your voice, your email to filter spam, and for computers to learn a bunch of other cool stuff.\n\nIn part two, you will learn about Unsupervised Learning. Ever wonder how Netflix can predict what movies you'll like? Or how Amazon knows what you want to buy before you do? Such answers can be found in this section!\n\nFinally, can we program machines to learn like humans? This Reinforcement Learning section will teach you the algorithms for designing self-learning agents like us!",

Firebase is an app development platform that provides developers with a variety of tools and a scalable infrastructure so that you can quickly build high quality apps.\n\n\nIn this course, you\u2019ll build FriendlyChat, a realtime text and picture chat application.\n\n\nTo start, you\u2019ll see how easy it is to read and write data to Firebase. After that, you\u2019ll learn how to let users login with their email or Google account. You\u2019ll then learn how to use Firebase\u2019s Security and Rules language to secure and add permissions to your data.\n\n\nIn the second lesson, you\u2019ll learn about Firebase Storage, which lets users upload content from their devices. Then you\u2019ll have a brief overview of Firebase Analytics so you can analyze app usage data to make decision about your app. Following that, you\u2019ll explore Firebase Notifications, which allow you to send notifications to customized segments of users.  Finally, you\u2019ll dive into Firebase Remote Config, which gives you the ability to tune and customize your app without having to publish a new version. By the end of this course you will have an Android application that can store and share data between different users in realtime as well as authenticate and authorize those users.",
